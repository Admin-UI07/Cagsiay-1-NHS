In conclusion, the purpose of these study is to raise awareness to the students on how important study habits to their academic performance. As researchers, they would recommend to the students to be more focus and give their efforts to their study, because it is the one that should help them to get a good academic performance and to achieve their goals in life. Teachers may also use a different kind of strategies to focus and help their student to study hard and this can eventually encourage them to develop their study habits even in taking notes and studying for exams. Parents may give an extra time for their child study habits when it comes to academic performance even though they are busy, it is because their child spend most of the time at home with them. Nevertheless, they may provide a comfortable space to study. To the future researchers this study is recommended to them, this may serve as their guide and reference for those who willing to conduct a related study about the factors affecting the study habits on academic performance.

                            Based on the findings of the study, the researchers concluded that the majority of the respondents chose Humanities and Social Sciences as their preferred strand.

                            Consequently, the researchers highly recommend to students that they choose the strand they really want to study.
